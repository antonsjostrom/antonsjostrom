## About Me

Hello!

I'm Anton Sjöström, a Quantitative Researcher at SEB, one of Scandinavia's leading Investment Banks.  
My work focuses on quantitative market-making strategies, leveraging probabilistic programming and statistical methods to generate actionable insights. This GitHub page showcases a selection of my public projects and provides information about my professional interests. The projects here are independent of my position at SEB and reflect my personal interests. While many repositories remain private during development, you are welcome to explore the available content.

## Digital Footprints

Sometimes I participate in monthly competitions where the goal is to solve a puzzle or math problem with a time constraint.  
One of these puzzles (Jane Street) has a leaderboard where you get your name published if you solve it.

Currently, you can find my name (Anton Sjöström) on the leaderboards of these puzzles:

- [March 2025 – Hall of Mirrors 3](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hall-of-mirrors-3-solution/)
- [November 2024 – Beside the Point](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/beside-the-point-solution/)
- [October 2024 – Knight Moves 6](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/knight-moves-6-solution/)
- [September 2024 – Fences 2](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/fences-2-solution/)
- [August 2024 – Tree Edge Triage](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/tree-edge-triage-solution/)

I have a repo where I aim to post more elaborate solutions to the puzzles. However, I haven’t been all that consistent with it, so there are more puzzles I’ve solved than ones I’ve actually written detailed solutions for.

That said, for the ones I have documented, they’re linked here: [Detailed Solutions](https://github.com/antonsjostrom/OnlinePuzzles/tree/main)

I also run a weekly quandary at work called _Quanton's Quandaries_, named after my nickname, Quanton. Some of the more interesting ones (and a few I've extended when the follow-up turned out to be worthwhile) are hosted in this repo: [Quantons Quandaries](https://github.com/antonsjostrom/QuantonsQuandaries)

## Fun Exploration Projects
I also do some project when I'm at home and have some extra time to explore some ideas.
These are more for me to learn something new, build intuition or test my knowledge and not anything cutting-edge.

- [BuzzingBoundary](https://github.com/antonsjostrom/BuzzingBoundary)

## Extra things
Here, I will share miscellaneous items, such as projects from university courses that I still have on my computer. They primarily serve to demonstrate specific skills I acquired during my studies.

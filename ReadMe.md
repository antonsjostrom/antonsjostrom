Hello, there! 
My name is Anton Sjöström, and I'm a Quantitative Researcher/Trader at SEB, one of the largest banks in Scandinavia. As someone with a passion for mathematics, I discovered during my university years that programming is an excellent tool for solving mathematical problems. As a result, I have created this GitHub profile to showcase a variety of math-related projects that I've been working on.
My profile will feature a mix of different projects, from solving puzzles by hand to tackling them through code. I also enjoy exploring machine learning and conducting hobby research. I believe that there's a lot of value in sharing knowledge, which is why I'm excited to use this platform to connect with fellow math enthusiasts and share my work with others.
Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to engaging with you on this platform!

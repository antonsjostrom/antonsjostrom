# About Me

Hi there!  
I'm Anton Sjöström, a Quantitative Researcher at SEB, one of Scandinavia's largest banks.  
My focus is on quantitative market-making strategies, leveraging tools like probabilistic programming to power my work and uncover actionable insights.

This GitHub page features a selection of my public projects.  
While many repositories remain private as they evolve, feel free to explore what's here—and stay tuned for updates as I continue to share and refine my work.

## Monthly Competitions

Sometimes I participate in monthly competitions where the goal is to solve a puzzle or math problem with a time constraint.  
One of these puzzles (Jane Street) has a leaderboard where you get your name published if you solve it.

Currently, you can find my name (Anton Sjöström) on the leaderboards of these puzzles:

- [March 2025 – Hall of Mirrors 3](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hall-of-mirrors-3-solution/)
- [November 2024 – Beside the Point](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/beside-the-point-solution/)

# Monthly Competitions
Sometimes I participate in monthly competitions where the goal is to solve a puzzle / math problem with a time constraint.
One of these puzzles (Jane Street) have a leaderboard where you get your name published if you solve it. 
Currently you can find my name (Anton Sjöström) on the leaderboards of these puzzles:
